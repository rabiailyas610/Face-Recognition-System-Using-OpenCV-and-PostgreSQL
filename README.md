# Face-Recognition-System-Using-OpenCV-and-PostgreSQL
This project is a face detection and recognition system using Python, OpenCV, imgbeddings, and PostgreSQL. It detects and crops faces from images, generates embeddings, and compares them to a database of stored faces. The closest match is identified using vector similarity, and the recognized face is displayed for verification.
